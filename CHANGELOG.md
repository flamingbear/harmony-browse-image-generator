## v0.0.0
### 2023-04-12

This initial version of the Harmony Browse Image Generator (HyBIG) sets up the
core infrastructure required for a backend service. It contains a HarmonyAdapter
class that can be invoked within a Harmony Kubernetes cluster, and will return
an empty PNG and ESRI world files (created by touch). The service itself will
be implemented in future tickets.
